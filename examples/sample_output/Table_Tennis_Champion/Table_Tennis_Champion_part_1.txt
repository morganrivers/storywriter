**Table Tennis Champion - Part 1/5: "Spin of Contempt"**  
*(Featuring: Apparent (Fictitious) Force, Euler Force)*  

---

The ping pong ball hung in the humid air of the Seoul underground gym like a droplet trapped in syrup. Kala Kim watched it, her pupils dilating as she parsed its lazy oscillations into differential equations. The flickering neon lights buzzed in time with her pulse. *Fluid. It’s all fluid.*  

“Again,” she barked.  

The ball machine whirred. A white sphere rocketed toward her at 20 m/s, backspin clawing at the air. Kala didn’t blink. To her, the ball wasn’t solid—it was a parcel of fluid caught in a rotating frame, its spin a Coriolis force made tangible. Her paddle snapped forward, imparting topspin with a calculated flick of her wrist.  

*Apparent force.*  

The ball curved midair, swerving right as if yanked by invisible strings. It struck the far corner of the table and *kicked*, leaping over her opponent’s desperate lunge.  

“Match point,” Kala said, not bothering to hide her smirk. Across the net, Li Wei—reigning national champion, crowd favorite, *fool*—sweated through his jersey. His coach muttered in Mandarin, something about demons and physics.  

“You’re cheating,” Li spat, gripping the table edge. “That spin… it’s not possible.”  

Kala rolled her eyes. “You’re playing in an inertial frame. I’m not.” She twirled her paddle, the carbon fibers humming. “Every topspin I create is a miniature Earth rotation. The Magnus effect *is* the Coriolis of this table.”  

The crowd murmured. They didn’t understand, of course. To them, she was just another arrogant prodigy with a mean streak. But Kala saw deeper. Three years ago, they’d fired her from the Korea Institute of Science and Technology for “interpersonal toxicity.” Now, she’d weaponized the very equations they’d dismissed as theoretical.  

The ball machine reloaded. Li served this time—a sidespin slider that danced like a drunk moth. Kala’s lips moved silently as she computed:  

*Angular velocity of paddle: Ω = 120 rad/s. Radius of ball contact: r = 0.02 m. Euler acceleration: a_E = -dΩ/dt × r.*  

Her wrist snapped counterclockwise, reversing spin mid-strike. The paddle’s sudden angular acceleration—a brutal 500 rad/s²—introduced an Euler force that canceled Li’s sidespin. The ball froze midair for a millisecond, then shot forward like a bullet.  

Li swung at ghosts. The ball kissed the table’s edge and died.  

“Game,” Kala said. The word tasted like acid.

**Intermission 1: The Physics of Contempt**  

1. **Apparent (Fictitious) Force**  
   - *What it is:* Forces that appear in non-inertial (accelerating) reference frames, like the Coriolis force on Earth or the Magnus effect on a spinning ball.  
   - *In the story:* Kala treats her topspin as a local Coriolis effect. By rotating the ball, she creates a pressure gradient (low pressure on top, high below), curving its trajectory—a *fictitious* force bending its path relative to Li’s inertial intuition.  
   - *Real-world analogy:* A sliced soccer ball swerving midair, or hurricanes deflecting right in the Northern Hemisphere.  

2. **Euler Force**  
   - *What it is:* A rotational fictitious force arising from angular acceleration (\(a_E = -\frac{d\boldsymbol{\Omega}}{dt} \times \boldsymbol{r}\)). Unlike steady spins (Coriolis), it’s the jerk of *changing* rotation.  
   - *In the story:* Kala’s rapid wrist flick (sudden Ω change) induces an Euler force perpendicular to the spin axis. She uses it to negate Li’s sidespin by matching then reversing angular momentum.  
   - *Real-world analogy:* A figure skater’s dizzy stumble when they abruptly stop spinning—their inner ear gets Euler-punched.

Li’s paddle clattered to the floor. The crowd’s applause was thin, scattered. Kala didn’t care. She stalked to the sidelines, where her “training rig” waited—a high-speed camera rigged to track spin vectors, its screen flashing Reynolds numbers and pressure coefficients.  

“You’re a monster,” Li whispered as she passed.  

“Monsters win,” she said, not breaking stride.  

That night, in her cramped apartment above a fish market, Kala replayed the match footage. The camera had captured every rotation: 92 revolutions per second on her winning strike, the Euler torque peaking at 0.3 N·m. She zoomed in on the moment her paddle reversed spin—the nanosecond where angular acceleration spiked.  

*They think it’s talent. It’s just Navier-Stokes with boundary conditions.*  

Her phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number:  

**> You play with forces you don’t understand.**  

Kala deleted it. The world was full of losers trying to psych her out.

The next morning brought the quarterfinals. Her opponent: some Danish kid with a YouTube following and a topspin loop he called “Thor’s Hammer.” Pathetic.  

Warm-ups began. Kala stood motionless as the kid fired shot after shot, each a carbon copy of the last.  

*No variation. No adaptation. Fluid dynamics is the study of change.*  

On match point, she demonstrated. A vicious backspin serve sent the ball skidding low. As the Dane lunged, Kala’s paddle jerked upward—a rapid angular acceleration that slapped Euler force into the ball’s underbelly. It rocketed upward, then *dived*, gravity and fictitious forces colluding to slam it beneath his paddle.  

The crowd gasped. The kid looked ready to cry.  

“You made it curve twice!” he stammered.  

“Once for each derivative in the Cauchy momentum equation,” Kala said, walking off.

By sundown, the messages escalated:  

**> Fictitious forces can’t protect you.**  
**> Euler’s ghost comes for arrogant children.**  

She blocked the number. Let them try. Physics didn’t care about threats.  

But as she lay awake that night, the fish stink seeping through the floorboards, Kala replayed Li Wei’s final words. *Monster.* The equations in her head fizzed like static.  

*They’re jealous. That’s all.*  

She closed her eyes, dreaming of rotating frames and pressure gradients. Somewhere in the darkness, a paddle spun faster and faster, its angular acceleration approaching infinity.
